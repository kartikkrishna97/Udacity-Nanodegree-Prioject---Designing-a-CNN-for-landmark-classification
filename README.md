# Udacity-Nanodegree-Prioject---Designing-a-CNN-for-landmark-classification
In this project I have immplemented trained a basic CNN classifier which has some fully connected layers as well to train them on the landmark classifiaction on the publicly available google landmark classification dataset. Apart from training a classifier I have also learnt about batch norm and learning rate schedulizer while learning to create a classifier
Along with this I have also used transfer learning and the pretrained VGG19 model on the same dataset
